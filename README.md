Personal Expenses Tracker

Overview

The Personal Expenses Tracker is a Python-based tool developed in a Jupyter Notebook to help users manage and track monthly expenses. Built as part of my ALX Data Science program, this project demonstrates proficiency in Python programming, data manipulation, and basic financial analytics, making it relevant for data analyst roles requiring budgeting and reporting skills.

Purpose

This project tracks a user's monthly budget, categorizes expenses, and calculates remaining balances, providing a simple yet effective way to monitor spending. It showcases my ability to:





Handle data structures (lists, variables) in Python.



Perform basic arithmetic operations for financial tracking.



Present results in a clear, formatted output for stakeholder reporting.

Features





User Inputs: Tracks user details, budget, and month (e.g., "Mutagen", $500, October 2025).



Expense Logging: Records multiple expense items, their amounts, categories (e.g., Housing, Entertainment), and necessity status.



Calculations: Computes total expenses, closing balance, and transaction count.



Output Summary: Displays a formatted summary with key metrics (e.g., opening/closing balance, number of transactions).

Technologies Used





Python 3.11.7: Core programming language.



Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for code and documentation.



Libraries: Standard Python (no external libraries like Pandas, focusing on core skills).

File Structure





Personal_Expenses_Tracker.ipynb: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the code and markdown explanations.
